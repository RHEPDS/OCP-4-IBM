# Repository for the OpenShift Virtualisation Training

Business Problem Statement 
There is a unique market opportunity now (for CY25) for Red Hat to support customers in moving away from VMware-based infrastructure and onto an OpenShift based one due to recent moves by the new owner of VMware, Broadcom. A key business activity to drive this motion with customers is performing a Red Hat Virtualization Migration Assessment.  Currently, there are not enough technical sellers able to successfully position and get the commitment from customers to take this first step in their migration away from VMWare.
